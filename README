Libre Numerals
--------------

A LibreOffice/OpenOffice Calc extension (AddIn) written in Java to print amount in words.

License: Apache v2 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

Uses third party library Numerals https://github.com/vitalker/numerals under GPL v3 (Apache 2 compatible)

Ant script was inspired by https://github.com/WollMux/WollMux

How to build from source code:

1. Instal JDK (I used 1.7 but 1.5,1.6,1.8 may work as well)
2. Install LibreOffice and LibO SDK
3. Install Apache Ant
4. Configure unix.properties when building on Linux (windows.properties for Windows) to point to LibO/SDK folders installed above
5. run ant

To edit source code I used IntelliJ Idea, you can import project there. You'll need to change path to LibO/SDK libraries if necessary.
